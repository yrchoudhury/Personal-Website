      <h2>Task 1 / CARP Posters</h2>
      <p>CARP Poster 1. </p>
      <p>Here we have been working on our CARP Posters. Our CARP (Contrast, Proximity, Repetition, Alignment)
        posters we have made, using Adobe Illustator we created a couple of draft posters for the True / False Film
        Festival in Missouri.
        These images you see below are my own created ones.</p>
      <p>I wanted to have this poster as a minimalistic kind of style for this one. What I had done for this one,
        I had used an eye image and fitted it into a small square pairing another one together
        making a sort of diamond shape. Then I had the T/F logo placed into the other square in align with the other
        image.
        I used a font called Bebas Neue across all 3 of my posters as I felt it matched with my posters.
      </p>

      <p>CARP Poster 2. </p>
      <p>For my 2nd CARP poster,I had this image of a film camera with a purple background on Pixabay. I used the
        eyedropper tool. to have a nice purple background. Then I had typed 'True / False Festival' and had changed
        the opacity of the text and replicated the text and placed it on the purple background to make a sort of
        monogram pattern across the poster.
      </p>

      <p>CARP Poster 3. </p>
      <p>Lastly, here is my final poster. for this one I added add some film strips it felt relevant to add to the
        poster. I slightly tilted them to add some style and flair to it. In addition to this I tilted all
        my text in the poster so it's like a theme within the image. Then I used the eyedropper tool on the True /
        False Festival logo and added some shapes to make the poster more obscure such as squares, crosses and circles.

      <h3> Report</h3>
      <p>For this project we had to make a website for the Graphic and Web design module. Along with our website we also
        had to do 4 tasks.
        Our first one was the CARP (Contrast, Proximity, Repetition and Alignment) Task. What we had to do was re-design
        a poster for the True / False festival,
        what we did is make 3 posters using Adobe InDesign. Incorporating contrast, repetition, alignment, and
        proximity.

        Our 2nd task was our coding task, where we had around 5 to 6 worksheets that we had been doing over the past
        months then we had to publish them on a platform called GitHub.
        Which allows the worksheets to be seen to the public and evaluate our worksheets / website we had ran on.

        Then for our 3rd task we had been looking at 8 different typographic systems. (Axial, Radial, Dilatational,
        Random, Grid, Modular, Transitional and Bilateral.) we had researched upon these systems then incorporated our
        own designs using Adobe Illustrator.

        Lastly, we had our User Experience task where we had created our own flowcharts explaining to users who may
        access my website and justify it. Such as giving an overview, a layout and explain the scope of the website.
        I feel like working on this project now will benefit me in the future as it has shown me what to expect to do
        later and it’s made me learn about a lot of new ideas / things that I will be able to integrate in the future.
        
        As perhaps after graduation I’d like to go into a similar field of work as a career.
        There was a lot of things I wanted to try out but due to my skill and time constraint I couldn’t make happen
        such as a lot of graphic designs on the buttons and such.

        I had inspiration from a few web designers but there was one who stood out to me the most. Who was Jess Tan, she
        is a very talented developer who is from PayPal. Her portfolio had a vast amount of exquisite vivid Ui’s and has
        smooth running animations on her websites.
        In conclusion I feel like my website is a sensible approach to modern web design as it helps users to navigate
        across all pages and focus on what they may need or want.
